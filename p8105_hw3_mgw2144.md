## Problem 1

## Problem 2

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")

brfss_smart2010_df = 
  brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(
    state = locationabbr,
    state_county = locationdesc
  ) %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  filter(response %in% c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")) %>% 
  mutate(
    response = factor(response, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent"), ordered = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(response)
```

Data was cleaned to re-format some variable names and clean the column
names, focus on the “Overall Health” topic, include only participants
whose answers ranged from “Excellent” to “Poor”, and so that the
responses were organized from “Poor” to “Excellent”.

``` r
brfss_2002 = 
  brfss_smart2010_df %>% 
  filter(year == "2002") %>% 
  count(state) %>% 
  filter(n >= 7)

brfss_2010 = 
  brfss_smart2010_df %>% 
  filter(year == "2010")%>% 
  count(state) %>% 
  filter(n >= 7)
```

In 2002, 21 states were observed at 7 or more locations including: CT,
DE FL, ID, IL, IN, MA, MD, MI, NE, NH, NJ, NV, NY, OH, OK, PA, RI, SC,
UT, and WA.

In 2010, 38 states were observed at 7 or more locations including: AL,
AR, AZ, CA, CO, DE FL, ID, IN, KS, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO, MT, NC,
NE, NH, NJ, NM, NV, NY, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VT, WA,
and WY.

``` r
brfss_exc = 
  brfss_smart2010_df %>% 
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>% 
  select(year, state, response, data_value) %>% 
  group_by(year, state) %>% 
  summarise(mean_dv = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_dv, color = state)) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_line() +
    labs(
      title = "Average Data Value Per State 2002-2010",
      x = "Year",
      y = "Average Data Value"
    )
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
brfss_exc
```

The result of this code is a “spaghetti” plot with one line for each
state in the data set as is represented by the state abbreviation. Each
data point connected by lines represents the average data value in
percent for each year by state. The average data value is represented by
the y-axis and the range of the graph on the y-axis is 10%-35%. Year is
represented on the x-axis with a range of 2002-2010.

``` r
brfss_two = 
 brfss_smart2010_df%>% 
  filter(
    state == "NY", year %in% c(2006, 2010)) %>% 
  mutate(
    state_county = sub(" County", "", state_county),
    state_county = sub("NY - ", "", state_county)
  ) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = response, y = data_value, fill = response))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
  facet_grid(state_county~year)+
  labs(
    x = "Response",
    y = "Average Data Value (%)",
    title = "Average Data Value For New York Counties in 2006 and 2010 by Response Type"
  )

## instructions

Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the
day. Make a three-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each education level and use color to indicate sex. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph;
including smooth trends may help identify differences.
